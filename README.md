Execution Context

- Memory Allocation
- Code Execution
- Synchronous Single Threaded Language
- Call Stack

### Hoisting
the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope â€“ all before code execution.

### Function Execution and variable Environment

### Window and this
whenever a js program is executed a global execution context is created along with the global object and this object.

### let,const and temporal dead zone
let is also hoisted but it is not hoisted on the global object, temporal dead zone is a time since "let" variable was hoisted and "let" was initialized


### Calllback Functions
Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.
